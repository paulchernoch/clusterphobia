/// Approximate the natural logarithm of the ratio of two unsigned integers to an accuracy of ±0.000025.
/// 
/// The algorithm follows this article: http://www.nezumi.demon.co.uk/consult/logx.htm):
/// 
/// ## Algorithm
///  
///   1. Range reduction to the interval [1, 2] by dividing by the largest power of two not exceeding the value:
///      - Change representation of numerator   → `2ⁿ·N where 1 ≤ N ≤ 2`
///      - Change representation of denominator → `2ᵈ·D where 1 ≤ D ≤ 2`
///   2. This makes the result `log(numerator/denominator) = log(2ⁿ·N / 2ᵈ·D) = (n-d)·log(2) + log(N) - log(D)`
///   3. To perform log(N), Taylor series does not converge in the neighborhood of zero, but it does near one...
///   4. ... since N is near one, substitute x = N - 1 so that we now need to evaluate log(1 + x)
///   5. Perform a substitution of `y = x/(2+x)`
///   6. Consider the related function `f(y) = Log((1+y)/(1-y))`
///      - `= Log((1 + x/(2+x)) / (1 - x/(2+x)))`
///      - `= Log( (2+2x) / 2)`
///      - `= Log(1 + x)`
///   7. f(y) has a Taylor Expansion which converges must faster than the expansion for Log(1+x) ... 
///      - For Log(1+x) → `x - x²/2 + x³/3 - y⁴/4 + ...`
///      - For Log((1+y)/(1-y)) → `y + y³/3 + y⁵/5 + ...`
///   8. Use the Padé Approximation for the truncated series `y + y³/3 + y⁵/5 ...`
///   9. ... Which is `2y·(15 - 4y²)/(15 - 9y²)`
///   10. Repeat for the denominator and combine the results.
/// 
/// ## Error Range
/// 
/// The interesting thing is to compare the error bars for the _Taylor series_ and its _Padé Approximation_: 
///    - Padé Approximation error is ±0.000025
///    - Taylor series has error ±0.00014 (five times worse)
